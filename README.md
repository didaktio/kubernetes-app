# Ionic-Angular-Course: Kubernetes (BONUS)
Source code for the Kubernetes tutorial from the `BONUS` section of the [Ionic Angular Course](https://github.com/didaktio/Ionic-Angular-Course).

# DEMO
[https://kubernetes-19955991.firebaseapp.com]

## Getting Started
1) Clone or download the repo.
2) Open a terminal at the root (or run `cd kubernetes-app`).
3) Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4) Rename `environments[EDIT AND RENAME]` to `environments`, and add your Firebase keys (as per the tutorial(s)).
5) Run `ionic s`.
6) Use code side-by-side with [Kubernetes Tutorial](https://skl.sh/2uzJ0JX).


## Possible Next Steps
* Complexify! Right now the app is embarrassingly simple. Try adding in some pages, components, features etc. There are no rules here!
* Modify the `Dockerfile`. Spend a few minutes reading the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/), and try some of the things out.
* Combine with [Ionic Gestures](https://ionicframework.com/docs/utilities/gestures).
* Replace and/or combine with [Ionic Animations](https://ionicframework.com/docs/utilities/animations).
* Add conditions for type of device, aided by [Platform](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/platform).
